\title{Time-varying impulse responses (unified: ML & penalized)}
\usage{
irf(fit, lags = 10, T.max = 5, B = 500, shock_vars = 1L, seed = 1234)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{tvvar_fit from \code{unpenalized_estimate()} or \code{penalized_estimate()}.}

\item{lags}{integer horizon (number of periods ahead).}

\item{T.max}{integer: how many time indices (from start) to evaluate.}

\item{B}{integer: Monte Carlo draws. For ML this is param draws; for penalized this is factor-path draws.}

\item{shock_vars}{integer vector of series to shock (1-based). Each shock is run separately.}

\item{seed}{integer base RNG seed.}
}
\value{
a named list of IRF objects (one per shocked series), each with
\code{IRF_lb}, \code{IRF_med}, \code{IRF_ub} (arrays N x lags x T.max),
and \code{meta}.
}
\description{
Computes IRFs for one or multiple one-unit shocks. If \code{fit$meta$method == "ML"},
parameters are drawn from the asymptotic covariance; otherwise (penalized)
coefficients are held fixed and only factor paths are simulated.
